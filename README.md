# Movie-Recommendation-System

Our goal is to design an algorithm in PySpark that works as good as Netflix’s recommender system. When we say “as good as”, we mean that the recommendations it gives are good based on only a few ratings of a new user. It is well-known that Netflix is a really powerful platform, which means that their investment in technology is huge. That means that the speed and accuracy of our recommendations will not match Netflix’s. In addition, Netflix uses a huge variety of recommender systems to recommend the top 10 series, as well as based on your favourite genre or based on your “previously watched”. We will do our best to create an efficient and meaningful code that simulates the “previously watched” tool that Netflix uses.

## Key Points
PySpark has been used in GCP cluster to write the code for data cleaning and implementation of the algorithm.

Python with flask was used to create an API.

HTML and CSS is used to design the front end
